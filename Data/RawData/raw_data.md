# Raw Data

Information about documents added to this folder.

The 'dummy data' document being brought in is the raw data from the first two
week of 
collection. 
The reason it is called dummy data is because it lists data from week one 
colonies as zero. This is inaccurate but our group wanted to practice the push
and pull of github, as well as work with uploading code.
