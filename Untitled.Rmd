This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
getwd()  # Check current working directory
setwd("C:/Users/kyoshiinari/Documents/Kyoshi Inari/MtA/MountA Bio/BIOL3111_envi micro/GitHub/worm_composting")  # Set working directory

```


```{r}
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("png", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("png")
}

# Load the png library
library(png)
library(grid)

# URL of the image on GitHub (replace with your GitHub image URL)
image_url <- "https://github.com/BIOL3111MtA2024/worm_composting/blob/main/Data/RawData/Method_Set_Up.png?raw=true"

# Temporary file to save the image
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")

# Download the image
download.file(image_url, temp_file, mode = "wb")

# Load the image
img <- readPNG(temp_file)

# Display the image
plot(1:2, type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", axes = TRUE)
rasterImage(img,1,1.2,1.15,1.4)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
